# Flappy MMD Game
available at https://darynakalinchuk.github.io/Seminar_Game/

Is a game largely inpired by 
- [Original Flappy Bird in JavaScript](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Original-Flappy-bird-JavaScript)
- The great `Mining Massive Data` lecture slides by *Assoz. Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Sebastian Tschiatschek, BSc.*
- Me getting not a very good grade on the subject and wanting to do at least something extra, plus having to do a game for the seminar.

## 🎯 Game Purpose

The game is designed to make learning lecture material more engaging and interactive. Currently, there are two levels based on the first two lectures (excluding the introductory one).

## 🎮 Gameplay

You control a floating **student** character using mouse clicks to keep them in the air. While doing so, you must answer multiple-choice questions that appear on the screen.

- **Answering**: Fly into one of the 2–3 available options. Only one is correct.
- **Avoid dropping**: If the student hits the ground, the round ends.
- **Skipping a question**: Not answering in time reduces your XP.
- **Speed modes**: Choose how fast you want the questions to appear:
  - 🐢 Slow
  - 🚲 Moderate
  - ⚡ God Mode

## 🧮 Scoring

- **Score** = Number of questions answered
- **XP** = `Score × 10 − Skipped_Questions × 15`
- Your highest XP is recorded and displayed to keep you motivated.
