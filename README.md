# Flappy MMD Game
available at https://darynakalinchuk.github.io/Seminar_Game/

Is a game inpired by 
- [Original Flappy Bird in JavaScript](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Original-Flappy-bird-JavaScript)
- The great `Mining Massive Data` lecture slides by *Assoz. Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Sebastian Tschiatschek, BSc.*
- Me getting not a very good grade on the subject and wanting to do at least something extra, plus having to do a game for the seminar.

## Game Purpose

The game is designed to make learning the MMD lecture material more engaging and interactive. Currently, there are two levels based on the first two lectures (excluding the introductory one).

## Gameplay

You control a floating **student** character using mouse clicks to keep them in the air. While doing so, you must answer multiple-choice questions that appear on the screen.

- **Answering**: Fly into one of the 2–3 available options. Only one is correct.
- **Avoid dropping**: If the student hits the ground, the round ends.
- **Skipping a question**: Not answering in time reduces your XP.
- **Speed modes**: Choose how fast you want the questions to appear:
  - 🐢 Slow
  - 🚲 Moderate
  - ⚡ God Mode
- **Pausing** the game is an option.

Before the game starts, the user is able to rerad the material from the lecture that would prepare him for the game test.
## Scoring

- **Score** = Number of questions answered
- **XP** = `Score × 10 − Skipped_Questions × 15`
- Your highest XP is recorded and displayed to keep you motivated.
